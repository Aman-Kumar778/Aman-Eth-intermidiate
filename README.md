## Description

This project is all about connecting your frontend with your smart contract and wallet i.e MetaMask. Here first we have written some function about how to connect your wallet , by using react useState (which helps to change the state of the program as the function works) and using its function to change its functionalities. Then we have created deposit and withdraw functions , where if the atm is found then it will get the balance according to the funciton call. Also fucntion like getOwner() and CheckNetwork() is also there , where u can get the details of the owner of the contract and the current network in which u are working right now. the network model works on the chain id , where u need to specify the id of the network .
